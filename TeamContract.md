### a lunch-trading app for adults
#### *This document describes our team social contract for this project*
Reference Establishing Norms

### Roles
- Taskmaster - Andrew Conlin
- Gitmaster - Charles Rooney
- Reportmaster - Emilio Ortiz Gonzalez

### Daily process
- Morning standup started by Taskmaster
  - New tasks assigned (by Taskmaster)
  - Yesterday? Today? Obstacles? (by Reportmaster)
- Pair program on assigned tasks
- Keep a record on issues that are non-blocking and discuss right after lunch at re-group meeting
- Bring up any blocking issues after 15 minutes of spinning your wheels
- EOD meeting 3pm EST discussing what each pair/person accomplished
- Immediately prior to end of day make applicable PRs, review each other’s code and merge into master

### Team expectations
- Each of us reserves the rights to our nights and weekends, and we have all been straightforward about when and how we can commit to working on the project
- If you have a blocking issue, slack before interrupting another’s train of coding-thought
- We will assign tasks vertically (instead of horizontally)
- None of us will specialize in terms of front-end and back-end code
- Share the mic
- Disagree often and discuss -- argue infrequently
- At least message the group and gain approval when you change what you are working on

### Issues
- If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:
  1. Take 10-15 minute break
  2. List out the pros / cons
  3. Vote on it
  4. If the vote is split, flip a coin
- If you are frustrated
  1. Take a walk or get some water
  2. Talk constructively about actionable items (e.g. raise your hand instead of interrupting, let me learn and struggle until I ask you for help, etc.)
  3. Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. mentor, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrated
